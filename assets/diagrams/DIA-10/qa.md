# DIA-10 — Production QA

**Production:** produced. **Release:** blocked.

## Delivered
Each required media/source/evidence file is enumerated by byte count and SHA-256 in delivery.json. Existing outputs are real rendered media, not placeholder filenames. Independent variants belong to this ticket. The original source brief and code remain unchanged.

## Checks actually performed
- Rasterization and PNG dimensions checked at 1920 × 1080. Motion files checked with ffprobe for H.264, 30 fps, yuv420p, frame count and expected duration; per-file results are retained. Support-only OPS-01 is not a motion asset.
- HTML/SVG content was loaded in installed Chromium, with every source/variant scene checked for out-of-canvas text. Nonlinear forward/backward seeking was compared for identical SVG output. Remote requests were monitored; none were used. This is not a full text-overlap or semantic-proof system.
- The 25 literal Program.vb excerpts are checked against their canonical source ranges by the supplied validator. Code highlighting does not alter source files. Code line-wrap arrows are display markers, not inserted VB syntax.
- Visual review: Standalone full-resolution detail variant and overview poster. Inspected playround-detail.png plus the main-flow overview. Guard order and the explicit inner-loop return path are represented; no recursive call is invented.
- The source-based War and shuffle fixtures are deterministic teaching examples, not recorded program execution. Source/fixture checks are in the batch's review reports.

## Reproduction
`python tools/render/render_assets.py --id DIA-10` from the package root for media assets. For OPS-01, use `python tools/render/finish_delivery.py --ops-only`. Read tools/render/REBUILD.md first. Tool versions: assets/ops/OPS-01/exports/capabilities.json.

## Remaining decisions
Assigned gates: R04, R05, R06. See evidence/claim-checks.json and docs/EDITORIAL_REGISTER.md.

No narration sync, sound design, final video assembly, full independent editorial clearance, or live program capture is certified here. Produced is intentionally different from release-approved.

## Asset-specific notes
- Overview and inner-loop detail are separate readable diagrams.
- The main graphic abbreviates the source increment as RoundNumber += 1 in prose only; it is not presented as a literal VB line.
- Source behavior retained: first empty-hand guard, second guard, draw, compare, tie/burn, repeat. R04/R05/R06 remain editorial gates.
