Three. If both players flip the same rank — two sevens, two kings, whatever — it's War. Each player places three cards face-down, then flips a fourth card face-up. Whoever's face-up card is higher takes the entire pot — all ten cards. If it's another tie, you do it again. War can chain.

**[VISUAL: Animation — two equal cards appear, then three face-down cards from each player, then two more face-up cards. The pot grows.]**

Four. You keep playing until one player has all 52 cards. That player wins. If a player can't put up enough cards for a war, they lose.

**[VISUAL: Step-by-step animation of a War sequence:]**
**Step 1: Two equal cards face up.**
**Step 2: Three face-down cards from each player.**
**Step 3: One face-up card from each player.**
**Step 4: Higher card takes everything.**

Each player burns up to three cards face-down — or fewer, if they don't have three left. Then the loop goes back to the top, draws again, and compares again. If it's another tie, another war. The pot keeps growing.
